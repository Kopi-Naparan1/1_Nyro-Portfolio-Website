Welcome!

This is my first portfolio website.

The purpose of this is to showcase my ability to:

(1) Be consistent.
(2) Build progressively
(3) Addicted to improvement

Making this website took many days, but it is all worth it. I learned a lot.

You might say, "Oh, this website is made using AI."

You're not entirely wrong. I believe that this website is 30% AI-written.

These include the:

(1) Improvements in CSS
(2) Structure and words of the HTML

Overall, this portfolio website marksthe foundation of my career as a website developer.
